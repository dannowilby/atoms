# Atoms

An atomic time tracker application.

# Implementation

The database design could be a bit cleaner, destructuring the supabase reponses into a common API.

Unfortunately the Terraform Netlify support could use some improvements. Specifically it is not yet possible to configure subdomains through the provider. If there ever becomes support for this feature, then I may refactor the provisioning.
